Banking Transactions & Customer Behavior Analytics
📌 Project Overview

This project delivers an end-to-end banking analytics solution built on the Berka dataset using a Galaxy Schema with multiple fact tables and shared dimensions.
The goal is to transform large-scale transactional data into meaningful business insights related to customer behavior, financial performance, and risk patterns.

The solution combines SQL, Python, Power BI, and Streamlit to demonstrate complete analytics ownership — from data modeling to visualization and business storytelling.
